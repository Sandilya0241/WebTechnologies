			<h3>Introduction to JavaScript</h3>
			<p>JavaScript is the programming language of the web. It started out as a way to add small bits of functionality to a website. But now JavaScript has evolved into much more.</p>
			<p>JavaScript is used on the vast majority of websites and is supported by every major browser. The language has evolved to support the creation of business applications on the web. And with web connectivity built in, almost any kind of utility, security or data application can be created using JavaScript. Games can be created with JavaScript as well.</p>
			<p>JavaScript is supported as a programming language for Unity engine(a popular game engine for 3D and 2D games). For large business applications, JavaScript is popular and has been embraced by a scalable language called TypeScript. This language is a superset of JavaScript, so we need to understand JavaScript well in order to write large-scale business applications and other software using TypeScript.</p>
			<h6>JavaScript for desktop applications:</h6>
			<p>JavaScript is not just for applications which run in browsers on the web but we can also create native applications for smartphones and tablets. A popular technology for this is <i>Apache Cordova</i>.</p>
			<h6>JavaScript for Server side applications:</h6>
			<p>JavaScript can also be used to create full-fledged applications for Mac and Windows desktops. There is no need for a browser at all. A popular technology to accomplish this is <i>Electron</i>. Writing server-side code can also be accomplished in JavaScript. We can create Webservers, web APIs and other services using a technology called <i>Node.js</i>. So JavaScript is a multi-platform language. It will run in any modern web browser.</p>
